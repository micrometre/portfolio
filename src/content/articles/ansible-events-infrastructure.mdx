# Event-Driven Infrastructure with Ansible Events

Modern infrastructure demands responsiveness and automation. Ansible Events represents a paradigm shift from traditional scheduled automation to reactive, event-driven infrastructure management. In this article, I'll explore how to leverage Ansible Events to build intelligent, self-healing systems.

## Introduction to Ansible Events

Ansible Events (formerly known as ansible-rulebook) is a powerful extension to the Ansible ecosystem that enables event-driven automation. Unlike traditional playbooks that run on a schedule or manual trigger, Ansible Events responds to real-time events from various sources.

## Architecture Overview

The event-driven architecture consists of:

1. **Event Sources** - Systems that generate events (monitoring tools, webhooks, message queues)
2. **Rulebooks** - Define conditions and actions for events
3. **Event Router** - Processes and routes events to appropriate handlers
4. **Action Handlers** - Execute Ansible playbooks or other automation tasks

## Key Benefits

### Reactive Infrastructure
- Immediate response to system changes
- Proactive issue resolution
- Reduced mean time to recovery (MTTR)

### Resource Optimization
- Event-triggered scaling
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Intelligent workload distribution

### Operational Efficiency
- Reduced manual intervention
- Consistent response patterns
- Improved reliability

## Implementation Example

You can find the complete code examples and configurations used in this article in my [ansible-events repository](https://github.com/micrometre/ansible-events) on GitHub.

### Setting Up Event Sources

```yaml
# rulebook.yml
---
- name: Infrastructure Events
  hosts: all
  sources:
    - ansible.eda.webhook:
        host: 0.0.0.0
        port: 5000
    
    - ansible.eda.prometheus:
        host: prometheus.example.com
        port: 9090
        
  rules:
    - name: High CPU Usage Alert
      condition: event.alert == "HighCPUUsage"
      action:
        run_playbook:
          name: scale_infrastructure.yml
          extra_vars:
            target_host: "{{ event.instance }}"
            scale_factor: 2
```

### Webhook Integration

```python
# webhook_sender.py
import requests
import json

def send_infrastructure_event(event_type, instance, metrics):
    webhook_url = "http://ansible-events:5000/webhook"
    
    payload = {
        "alert": event_type,
        "instance": instance,
        "metrics": metrics,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        webhook_url,
        data=json.dumps(payload),
        headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    )
    
    return response.status_code == 200
```

### Scaling Playbook

```yaml
# scale_infrastructure.yml
---
- name: Scale Infrastructure
  hosts: "{{ target_host }}"
  vars:
    scale_factor: "{{ scale_factor | default(1.5) }}"
    
  tasks:
    - name: Get current instance count
      community.aws.ec2_instance_info:
        region: "{{ aws_region }}"
        filters:
          tag:Environment: "{{ environment }}"
          instance-state-name: running
      register: current_instances
    
    - name: Calculate new instance count
      set_fact:
        new_instance_count: "{{ (current_instances.instances | length * scale_factor) | int }}"
    
    - name: Launch additional instances
      community.aws.ec2_instance:
        region: "{{ aws_region }}"
        image_id: "{{ ami_id }}"
        instance_type: "{{ instance_type }}"
        count: "{{ new_instance_count - current_instances.instances | length }}"
        tags:
          Environment: "{{ environment }}"
          AutoScaled: "true"
      when: new_instance_count > current_instances.instances | length
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Automatic Scaling
**Trigger**: High resource utilization alerts
**Action**: Launch additional compute instances
**Benefits**: Maintains performance during traffic spikes

### 2. Security Response
**Trigger**: Security incident detection
**Action**: Isolate affected systems, apply patches
**Benefits**: Rapid threat containment

### 3. Disaster Recovery
**Trigger**: Service outage detection
**Action**: Failover to backup systems
**Benefits**: Minimized downtime

### 4. Cost Optimization
**Trigger**: Low utilization periods
**Action**: Scale down resources
**Benefits**: Reduced operational costs

## Cloud Platform Integration

### AWS Integration

```yaml
- name: AWS CloudWatch Events
  condition: event.source == "aws.cloudwatch"
  action:
    run_playbook:
      name: aws_response.yml
      extra_vars:
        alarm_name: "{{ event.alarm_name }}"
        region: "{{ event.region }}"
```

### Azure Integration

```yaml
- name: Azure Monitor Events
  condition: event.resourceProvider == "Microsoft.Compute"
  action:
    run_playbook:
      name: azure_vm_management.yml
      extra_vars:
        resource_group: "{{ event.resourceGroupName }}"
```

### Google Cloud Integration

```yaml
- name: GCP Pub/Sub Events
  condition: event.data.severity == "ERROR"
  action:
    run_playbook:
      name: gcp_incident_response.yml
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Event Filtering
- Implement proper event filtering to avoid noise
- Use meaningful condition expressions
- Set up event deduplication

### 2. Error Handling
- Include error handling in rulebooks
- Set up notification for failed actions
- Implement retry mechanisms

### 3. Security Considerations
- Secure webhook endpoints with authentication
- Use encrypted connections for event sources
- Implement proper access controls

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Track event processing metrics
- Log all automation actions
- Set up alerting for system health

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management
```yaml
# Optimized rulebook structure
- name: Optimized Event Processing
  throttle:
    group_by_attributes:
      - event.instance
    window_seconds: 300
  condition: event.alert == "ResourceAlert"
```

### Parallel Processing
- Configure multiple event processors
- Implement event partitioning
- Use async playbook execution

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics to Track
- Event processing latency
- Action success rates
- System responsiveness
- Resource utilization

### Integration with Observability Tools
```yaml
- name: Send Metrics to Prometheus
  action:
    run_module:
      name: uri
      args:
        url: "http://pushgateway:9091/metrics/job/ansible-events"
        method: POST
        body: |
          ansible_events_processed_total{{ '{' }}instance="{{ inventory_hostname }}"{{ '}' }} 1
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Event Source Connectivity
- Verify network connectivity
- Check authentication credentials
- Monitor event source health

### Performance Bottlenecks
- Profile event processing times
- Optimize condition expressions
- Scale event processors horizontally

## Future Developments

The Ansible Events ecosystem continues to evolve with:

1. **Enhanced Source Plugins** - More integration options
2. **Improved Performance** - Faster event processing
3. **Better Observability** - Enhanced monitoring capabilities
4. **AI Integration** - Intelligent event correlation

## Conclusion
